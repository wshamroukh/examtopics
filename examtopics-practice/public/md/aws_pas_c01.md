## Exam AWS Certified SAP on AWS - Specialty PAS-C01 topic 1 question 107 discussion

A company recently migrated its SAP workload to AWS. The company's SAP engineer implements SAProuter on an Amazon EC2 instance that runs SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. The EC2 instance is in a public subnet and is an On-Demand Instance. The SAP engineer performs all the necessary configurations for SAProuter, security groups, and route tables.

The SAProuter system needs to be online and available only when SAP Support is needed. The SAP engineer performs an initial test to validate SAP Support connectivity with SAProuter. The test is successful, and the SAP engineer stops the EC2 instance.

When an event occurs that causes the company to need SAP Support, the company starts the EC2 instance that hosts SAProuter. After the EC2 instance is running, the SAP Support team cannot establish connectivity with SAProuter.

What should the SAP engineer do to permanently resolve this issue?

**A:** Re-install SAProuter on an EC2 instance in a private subnet. Update the SAProuter configuration with the instance's private IP address. Deploy a managed NAT gateway for AWS. Route SAP connectivity through the NAT gateway.

A data analysis company has two SAP landscapes that consist of sandbox, development, QA, pre-production, and production servers. One landscape is on Windows, and the other landscape is on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The servers reside in a room in a building that other tenants share.
An SAP solutions architect proposes to migrate the SAP applications to AWS. The SAP solutions architect wants to move the production backups to AWS and wants to make the backups highly available to restore in case of unavailability of an on-premises server.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

**A:** Take a backup of the production servers. Implement an AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway. Create file shares by using the Storage Gateway Volume Gateway. Copy the backup files to the file shares through NFS and SMB.

**B:** Take a backup of the production servers. Send those backups to tape drives. Implement an AWS Storage Gateway Tape Gateway. Send the backups to Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) through the S3 console. Move the backups immediately to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

**C:** Implement a third-party tool to take images of the SAP application servers and database server. Take regular snapshots at 1-hour intervals. Send the snapshots to Amazon S3 Glacier directly through the S3 Glacier console. Store the same images in different S3 buckets in different AWS Regions.

**D:** Take a backup of the production servers. Implement an Amazon S3 File Gateway. Create file shares by using the S3 File Gateway. Copy the backup files to the file shares through NFS and SMB. Map backup files directly to Amazon S3. Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to send the backup files to S3 Glacier based on the company’s data retention policy.
