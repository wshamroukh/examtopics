A company is using Amazon S3 buckets to store important documents. The company discovers that some S3 buckets are not encrypted. Currently, the company’s IAM users can create new S3 buckets without encryption. The company is implementing a new requirement that all S3 buckets must be encrypted.

A DevOps engineer must implement a solution to ensure that server-side encryption is enabled on all existing S3 buckets and all new S3 buckets. The encryption must be enabled on new S3 buckets as soon as the S3 buckets are created. The default encryption type must be 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256).

Which solution will meet these requirements?

**A:** Create an AWS Lambda function that is invoked periodically by an Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule. Program the Lambda function to scan all current S3 buckets for encryption status and to set AES-256 as the default encryption for any S3 bucket that does not have an encryption configuration.

**B:** Set up and activate the s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled AWS Config managed rule. Configure the rule to use the AWS-EnableS3BucketEncryption AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook as the remediation action. Manually run the re-evaluation process to ensure that existing S3 buckets are compliant.

**C:** Create an AWS Lambda function that is invoked by an Amazon EventBridge event rule. Define the rule with an event pattern that matches the creation of new S3 buckets. Program the Lambda function to parse the EventBridge event, check the configuration of the S3 buckets from the event, and set AES-256 as the default encryption.

**D:** Configure an IAM policy that denies the s3:CreateBucket action if the s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption condition key has a value that is not AES-256. Create an IAM group for all the company’s IAM users. Associate the IAM policy with the IAM group.

A company has developed a static website hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket. The website is deployed using AWS CloudFormation. The CloudFormation template defines an S3 bucket and a custom resource that copies content into the bucket from a source location.

The company has decided that it needs to move the website to a new location, so the existing CloudFormation stack must be deleted and re-created. However, CloudFormation reports that the stack could not be deleted cleanly.

What is the MOST likely cause and how can the DevOps engineer mitigate this problem for this and future versions of the website?

**A:** Deletion has failed because the S3 bucket has an active website configuration. Modify the CloudFormation template to remove the WebsiteConfiguration property from the S3 bucket resource.

**B:** Deletion has failed because the S3 bucket is not empty. Modify the custom resource's AWS Lambda function code to recursively empty the bucket when RequestType is Delete.

**C:** Deletion has failed because the custom resource does not define a deletion policy. Add a DeletionPolicy property to the custom resource definition with a value of RemoveOnDeletion.

A company is migrating its container-based workloads to an AWS Organizations multi-account environment. The environment consists of application workload accounts that the company uses to deploy and run the containerized workloads. The company has also provisioned a shared services account for shared workloads in the organization.

The company must follow strict compliance regulations. All container images must receive security scanning before they are deployed to any environment. Images can be consumed by downstream deployment mechanisms after the images pass a scan with no critical vulnerabilities. Pre-scan and post-scan images must be isolated from one another so that a deployment can never use pre-scan images.

A DevOps engineer needs to create a strategy to centralize this process.

Which combination of steps will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead? (Choose two.)

**A:** Create Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repositories in the shared services account: one repository for each pre-scan image and one repository for each post-scan image. Configure Amazon ECR image scanning to run on new image pushes to the pre-scan repositories. Use resource-based policies to grant the organization write access to the pre-scan repositories and read access to the post-scan repositories.

**B:** Create pre-scan Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repositories in each account that publishes container images. Create repositories for post-scan images in the shared services account. Configure Amazon ECR image scanning to run on new image pushes to the pre-scan repositories. Use resource-based policies to grant the organization read access to the post-scan repositories.

**C:** Configure image replication for each image from the image's pre-scan repository to the image's post-scan repository.

**D:** Create a pipeline in AWS CodePipeline for each pre-scan repository. Create a source stage that runs when new images are pushed to the pre-scan repositories. Create a stage that uses AWS CodeBuild as the action provider. Write a buildspec.yaml definition that determines the image scanning status and pushes images without critical vulnerabilities to the post-scan repositories.

**E:** Create an AWS Lambda function. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts to image scanning completed events and invokes the Lambda function. Write function code that determines the image scanning status and pushes images without critical vulnerabilities to the post-scan repositories.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 84 discussion

A company has a guideline that every Amazon EC2 instance must be launched from an AMI that the company’s security team produces. Every month, the security team sends an email message with the latest approved AMIs to all the development teams.

The development teams use AWS CloudFormation to deploy their applications. When developers launch a new service, they have to search their email for the latest AMIs that the security department sent. A DevOps engineer wants to automate the process that the security team uses to provide the AMI IDs to the development teams.

What is the MOST scalable solution that meets these requirements?

**A:** Direct the security team to use CloudFormation to create new versions of the AMIs and to list the AMI ARNs in an encrypted Amazon S3 object as part of the stack’s Outputs section. Instruct the developers to use a cross-stack reference to load the encrypted S3 object and obtain the most recent AMI ARNs.

**B:** Direct the security team to use a CloudFormation stack to create an AWS CodePipeline pipeline that builds new AMIs and places the latest AMI ARNs in an encrypted Amazon S3 object as part of the pipeline output. Instruct the developers to use a cross-stack reference within their own CloudFormation template to obtain the S3 object location and the most recent AMI ARNs.

**C:** Direct the security team to use Amazon EC2 Image Builder to create new AMIs and to place the AMI ARNs as parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Instruct the developers to specify a parameter of type SSM in their CloudFormation stack to obtain the most recent AMI ARNs from Parameter Store.

**D:** Direct the security team to use Amazon EC2 Image Builder to create new AMIs and to create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic so that every development team can receive notifications. When the development teams receive a notification, instruct them to write an AWS Lambda function that will update their CloudFormation stack with the most recent AMI ARNs.

A DevOps engineer needs to configure a blue/green deployment for an existing three-tier application. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon RDS database. The EC2 instances run behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and are in an Auto Scaling group.

The DevOps engineer has created a launch template and an Auto Scaling group for the blue environment. The DevOps engineer also has created a launch template and an Auto Scaling group for the green environment. Each Auto Scaling group deploys to a matching blue or green target group. The target group also specifies which software, blue or green, gets loaded on the EC2 instances. The ALB can be configured to send traffic to the blue environment’s target group or the green environment’s target group. An Amazon Route 53 record for www.example.com points to the ALB.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 131 discussion

A company builds a container image in an AWS CodeBuild project by running Docker commands. After the container image is built, the CodeBuild project uploads the container image to an Amazon S3 bucket. The CodeBuild project has an IAM service role that has permissions to access the S3 bucket.

A DevOps engineer needs to replace the S3 bucket with an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository to store the container images. The DevOps engineer creates an ECR private image repository in the same AWS Region of the CodeBuild project. The DevOps engineer adjusts the IAM service role with the permissions that are necessary to work with the new ECR repository. The DevOps engineer also places new repository information into the docker build command and the docker push command that are used in the buildspec.yml file.

When the CodeBuild project runs a build job, the job fails when the job tries to access the ECR repository.

Which solution will resolve the issue of failed access to the ECR repository?

**A:** Update the buildspec.yml file to log in to the ECR repository by using the aws ecr get-login-password AWS CLI command to obtain an authentication token. Update the docker login command to use the authentication token to access the ECR repository.

**B:** Add an environment variable of type SECRETS_MANAGER to the CodeBuild project. In the environment variable, include the ARN of the CodeBuild project's IAM service role. Update the buildspec.yml file to use the new environment variable to log in with the docker login command to access the ECR repository.

**C:** Update the ECR repository to be a public image repository. Add an ECR repository policy that allows the IAM service role to have access.

**D:** Update the buildspec.yml file to use the AWS CLI to assume the IAM service role for ECR operations. Add an ECR repository policy that allows the IAM service role to have access.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 3 discussion

A company is adopting AWS CodeDeploy to automate its application deployments for a Java-Apache Tomcat application with an Apache Webserver. The development team started with a proof of concept, created a deployment group for a developer environment, and performed functional tests within the application. After completion, the team will create additional deployment groups for staging and production.
The current log level is configured within the Apache settings, but the team wants to change this configuration dynamically when the deployment occurs, so that they can set different log level configurations depending on the deployment group without having a different application revision for each group.
How can these requirements be met with the LEAST management overhead and without requiring different script versions for each deployment group?

**A:** Tag the Amazon EC2 instances depending on the deployment group. Then place a script into the application revision that calls the metadata service and the EC2 API to identify which deployment group the instance is part of. Use this information to configure the log level settings. Reference the script as part of the AfterInstall lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml file.

**B:** Create a script that uses the CodeDeploy environment variable DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_ NAME to identify which deployment group the instance is part of. Use this information to configure the log level settings. Reference this script as part of the BeforeInstall lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml file.

**C:** Create a CodeDeploy custom environment variable for each environment. Then place a script into the application revision that checks this environment variable to identify which deployment group the instance is part of. Use this information to configure the log level settings. Reference this script as part of the ValidateService lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml file.

**D:** Create a script that uses the CodeDeploy environment variable DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_ID to identify which deployment group the instance is part of to configure the log level settings. Reference this script as part of the Install lifecycle hook in the appspec.yml file.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 55 discussion

A company has deployed an application in a production VPC in a single AWS account. The application is popular and is experiencing heavy usage. The company’s security team wants to add additional security, such as AWS WAF, to the application deployment. However, the application's product manager is concerned about cost and does not want to approve the change unless the security team can prove that additional security is necessary.
The security team believes that some of the application's demand might come from users that have IP addresses that are on a deny list. The security team provides the deny list to a DevOps engineer. If any of the IP addresses on the deny list access the application, the security team wants to receive automated notification in near real time so that the security team can document that the application needs additional security. The DevOps engineer creates a VPC flow log for the production VPC.
Which set of additional steps should the DevOps engineer take to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

**A:** Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Configure the VPC flow log to capture accepted traffic and to send the data to the log group. Create an Amazon CloudWatch metric filter for IP addresses on the deny list. Create a CloudWatch alarm with the metric filter as input. Set the period to 5 minutes and the datapoints to alarm to 1. Use an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to send alarm notices to the security team.

**B:** Create an Amazon S3 bucket for log files. Configure the VPC flow log to capture all traffic and to send the data to the S3 bucket. Configure Amazon Athena to return all log files in the S3 bucket for IP addresses on the deny list. Configure Amazon QuickSight to accept data from Athena and to publish the data as a dashboard that the security team can access. Create a threshold alert of 1 for successful access. Configure the alert to automatically notify the security team as frequently as possible when the alert threshold is met.

**C:** Create an Amazon S3 bucket for log files. Configure the VPC flow log to capture accepted traffic and to send the data to the S3 bucket. Configure an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster and domain for the log files. Create an AWS Lambda function to retrieve the logs from the S3 bucket, format the logs, and load the logs into the OpenSearch Service cluster. Schedule the Lambda function to run every 5 minutes. Configure an alert and condition in OpenSearch Service to send alerts to the security team through an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when access from the IP addresses on the deny list is detected.

**D:** Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to hold query results. Configure the VPC flow log to capture all traffic and to send the data to the log group. Deploy an Amazon Athena CloudWatch connector in AWS Lambda. Connect the connector to the log group. Configure Athena to periodically query for all accepted traffic from the IP addresses on the deny list and to store the results in the S3 bucket. Configure an S3 event notification to automatically notify the security team through an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when new objects are added to the S3 bucket.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 326 discussion

A company uses an organization in AWS Organizations to manage its 500 AWS accounts. The organization has all features enabled. The AWS accounts are in a single OU. The developers need to use the CostCenter tag key for all resources in the organization's member accounts. Some teams do not use the CostCenter tag key to tag their Amazon EC2 instances.

The cloud team wrote a script that scans all EC2 instances in the organization's member accounts. If the EC2 instances do not have a CostCenter tag key, the script will notify AWS account administrators. To avoid this notification, some developers use the CostCenter tag key with an arbitrary string in the tag value.

The cloud team needs to ensure that all EC2 instances in the organization use a CostCenter tag key with the appropriate cost center value.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

**A:** Create an SCP that prevents the creation of EC2 instances without the CostCenter tag key. Create a tag policy that requires the CostCenter tag to be values from a known list of cost centers for all EC2 instances. Attach the policy to the OU. Update the script to scan the tag keys and tag values. Modify the script to update noncompliant resources with a default approved tag value for the CostCenter tag key.

**B:** Create an SCP that prevents the creation of EC2 instances without the CostCenter tag key. Attach the policy to the OU. Update the script to scan the tag keys and tag values and notify the administrators when the tag values are not valid.

**C:** Create an SCP that prevents the creation of EC2 instances without the CostCenter tag key. Attach the policy to the OU. Create an IAM permission boundary in the organization's member accounts that restricts the CostCenter tag values to a list of valid cost centers.

**D:** Create a tag policy that requires the CostCenter tag to be values from a known list of cost centers for all EC2 instances. Attach the policy to the OU.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 282 discussion

A DevOps engineer manages a Java-based application that runs in an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster on AWS Fargate. Auto scaling has not been configured for the application.

The DevOps engineer has determined that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) thread count is a good indicator of when to scale the application. The application serves customer traffic on port 8080 and makes JVM metrics available on port 9404.

Application use has recently increased. The DevOps engineer needs to configure auto scaling for the application.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)

**A:** Deploy the Amazon CloudWatch agent as a container sidecar. Configure the CloudWatch agent to retrieve JVM metrics from port 9404. Create CloudWatch alarms on the JVM thread count metric to scale the application. Add a step scaling policy in Fargate to scale up and scale down based on the CloudWatch alarms.

**B:** Deploy the Amazon CloudWatch agent as a container sidecar. Configure a metric filter for the JVM thread count metric on the CloudWatch log group for the CloudWatch agent. Add a target tracking policy in Fargate. Select the metric from the metric filter as a scale target.

**C:** Create an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace. Deploy AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry as a container sidecar to publish the JVM metrics from port 9404 to the Prometheus workspace. Configure rules for the workspace to use the JVM thread count metric to scale the application. Add a step scaling policy in Fargate. Select the Prometheus rules to scale up and scaling down.

**D:** Create an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace. Deploy AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry as a container sidecar to retrieve JVM metrics from port 9404 to publish the JVM metrics from port 9404 to the Prometheus workspace.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 176 discussion

A company has configured an Amazon S3 event source on an AWS Lambda function. The company needs the Lambda function to run when a new object is created or an existing object is modified in a particular S3 bucket. The Lambda function will use the S3 bucket name and the S3 object key of the incoming event to read the contents of the created or modified S3 object. The Lambda function will parse the contents and save the parsed contents to an Amazon DynamoDB table.

The Lambda function's execution role has permissions to read from the S3 bucket and to write to the DynamoDB table. During testing, a DevOps engineer discovers that the Lambda function does not run when objects are added to the S3 bucket or when existing objects are modified.

Which solution will resolve this problem?

**A:** Increase the memory of the Lambda function to give the function the ability to process large files from the S3 bucket.

**B:** Create a resource policy on the Lambda function to grant Amazon S3 the permission to invoke the Lambda function for the S3 bucket.

A healthcare services company is concerned about the growing costs of software licensing for an application for monitoring patient wellness. The company wants to create an audit process to ensure that the application is running exclusively on Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts. A DevOps engineer must create a workflow to audit the application to ensure compliance.

What steps should the engineer take to meet this requirement with the LEAST administrative overhead?

**A:** Use AWS Systems Manager Configuration Compliance. Use calls to the put-compliance-items API action to scan and build a database of noncompliant EC2 instances based on their host placement configuration. Use an Amazon DynamoDB table to store these instance IDs for fast access. Generate a report through Systems Manager by calling the list-compliance-summaries API action.

**B:** Use custom Java code running on an EC2 instance. Set up EC2 Auto Scaling for the instance depending on the number of instances to be checked. Send the list of noncompliant EC2 instance IDs to an Amazon SQS queue. Set up another worker instance to process instance IDs from the SQS queue and write them to Amazon DynamoDUse an AWS Lambda function to terminate noncompliant instance IDs obtained from the queue, and send them to an Amazon SNS email topic for distribution.

**C:** Use AWS Config. Identify all EC2 instances to be audited by enabling Config Recording on all Amazon EC2 resources for the region. Create a custom AWS Config rule that triggers an AWS Lambda function by using the "config-rule-change -triggered" blueprint. Modify the Lambda evaluateCompliance() function to verify host placement to return a NON_COMPLIANT result if the instance is not running on an EC2 Dedicated Host. Use the AWS Config report to address noncompliant instances.

**D:** Use AWS CloudTrail. Identify all EC2 instances to be audited by analyzing all calls to the EC2 RunCommand API action. Invoke an AWS Lambda function that analyzes the host placement of the instance. Store the EC2 instance ID of noncompliant resources in an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. Generate a report by querying the RDS instance and exporting the query results to a CSV text file.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 216 discussion

A company releases a new application in a new AWS account. The application includes an AWS Lambda function that processes messages from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The Lambda function stores the results in an Amazon S3 bucket for further downstream processing. The Lambda function needs to process the messages within a specific period of time after the messages are published. The Lambda function has a batch size of 10 messages and takes a few seconds to process a batch of messages.

As load increases on the application's first day of service, messages in the queue accumulate at a greater rate than the Lambda function can process the messages. Some messages miss the required processing timelines. The logs show that many messages in the queue have data that is not valid. The company needs to meet the timeline requirements for messages that have valid data.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

**A:** Increase the Lambda function's batch size. Change the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Request a Lambda concurrency increase in the AWS Region.

**B:** Reduce the Lambda function's batch size. Increase the SQS message throughput quota. Request a Lambda concurrency increase in the AWS Region.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 112 discussion

A DevOps engineer has implemented a CI/CD pipeline to deploy an AWS CloudFormation template that provisions a web application. The web application consists of an Application Load Balancer (ALB), a target group, a launch template that uses an Amazon Linux 2 AMI, an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances, a security group, and an Amazon RDS for MySQL database. The launch template includes user data that specifies a script to install and start the application.

The initial deployment of the application was successful. The DevOps engineer made changes to update the version of the application with the user data. The CI/CD pipeline has deployed a new version of the template. However, the health checks on the ALB are now failing. The health checks have marked all targets as unhealthy.

During investigation, the DevOps engineer notices that the CloudFormation stack has a status of UPDATE_COMPLETE. However, when the DevOps engineer connects to one of the EC2 instances and checks /var/log/messages, the DevOps engineer notices that the Apache web server failed to start successfully because of a configuration error.

How can the DevOps engineer ensure that the CloudFormation deployment will fail if the user data fails to successfully finish running?

**A:** Use the cfn-signal helper script to signal success or failure to CloudFormation. Use the WaitOnResourceSignals update policy within the CloudFormation template. Set an appropriate timeout for the update policy.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 113 discussion

A company has a data ingestion application that runs across multiple AWS accounts. The accounts are in an organization in AWS Organizations. The company needs to monitor the application and consolidate access to the application. Currently, the company is running the application on Amazon EC2 instances from several Auto Scaling groups. The EC2 instances have no access to the internet because the data is sensitive. Engineers have deployed the necessary VPC endpoints. The EC2 instances run a custom AMI that is built specifically for the application.

To maintain and troubleshoot the application, system administrators need the ability to log in to the EC2 instances. This access must be automated and controlled centrally. The company’s security team must receive a notification whenever the instances are accessed.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

**A:** Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to send notifications to the security team whenever a user logs in to an EC2 instance. Use EC2 Instance Connect to log in to the instances. Deploy Auto Scaling groups by using AWS CloudFormation. Use the cfn-init helper script to deploy appropriate VPC routes for external access. Rebuild the custom AMI so that the custom AMI includes AWS Systems Manager Agent.

**B:** Deploy a NAT gateway and a bastion host that has internet access. Create a security group that allows incoming traffic on all the EC2 instances from the bastion host. Install AWS Systems Manager Agent on all the EC2 instances. Use Auto Scaling group lifecycle hooks for monitoring and auditing access. Use Systems Manager Session Manager to log in to the instances. Send logs to a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export data to Amazon S3 for auditing. Send notifications to the security team by using S3 event notifications.

**C:** Use EC2 Image Builder to rebuild the custom AMI. Include the most recent version of AWS Systems Manager Agent in the image. Configure the Auto Scaling group to attach the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore role to all the EC2 instances. Use Systems Manager Session Manager to log in to the instances. Enable logging of session details to Amazon S3. Create an S3 event notification for new file uploads to send a message to the security team through an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.

**D:** Use AWS Systems Manager Automation to build Systems Manager Agent into the custom AMI. Configure AWS Config to attach an SCP to the root organization account to allow the EC2 instances to connect to Systems Manager. Use Systems Manager Session Manager to log in to the instances. Enable logging of session details to Amazon S3. Create an S3 event notification for new file uploads to send a message to the security team through an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 15 discussion

To run an application, a DevOps engineer launches an Amazon EC2 instance with public IP addresses in a public subnet. A user data script obtains the application artifacts and installs them on the instances upon launch. A change to the security classification of the application now requires the instances to run with no access to the internet. While the instances launch successfully and show as healthy, the application does not seem to be installed.
Which of the following should successfully install the application while complying with the new rule?

**A:** Launch the instances in a public subnet with Elastic IP addresses attached. Once the application is installed and running, run a script to disassociate the Elastic IP addresses afterwards.

**B:** Set up a NAT gateway. Deploy the EC2 instances to a private subnet. Update the private subnet's route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route.

**C:** Publish the application artifacts to an Amazon S3 bucket and create a VPC endpoint for S3. Assign an IAM instance profile to the EC2 instances so they can read the application artifacts from the S3 bucket.

**D:** Create a security group for the application instances and allow only outbound traffic to the artifact repository. Remove the security group rule once the install is complete.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 121 discussion

A company is building a new pipeline by using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild in a build account. The pipeline consists of two stages. The first stage is a CodeBuild job to build and package an AWS Lambda function. The second stage consists of deployment actions that operate on two different AWS accounts: a development environment account and a production environment account. The deployment stages use the AWS CloudFormation action that CodePipeline invokes to deploy the infrastructure that the Lambda function requires.

A DevOps engineer creates the CodePipeline pipeline and configures the pipeline to encrypt build artifacts by using the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key for Amazon S3 (the aws/s3 key). The artifacts are stored in an S3 bucket. When the pipeline runs, the CloudFormation actions fail with an access denied error.

Which combination of actions must the DevOps engineer perform to resolve this error? (Choose two.)

**A:** Create an S3 bucket in each AWS account for the artifacts. Allow the pipeline to write to the S3 buckets. Create a CodePipeline S3 action to copy the artifacts to the S3 bucket in each AWS account. Update the CloudFormation actions to reference the artifacts S3 bucket in the production account.

**B:** Create a customer managed KMS key. Configure the KMS key policy to allow the IAM roles used by the CloudFormation action to perform decrypt operations. Modify the pipeline to use the customer managed KMS key to encrypt artifacts.

**C:** Create an AWS managed KMS key. Configure the KMS key policy to allow the development account and the production account to perform decrypt operations. Modify the pipeline to use the KMS key to encrypt artifacts.

**D:** In the development account and in the production account, create an IAM role for CodePipeline. Configure the roles with permissions to perform CloudFormation operations and with permissions to retrieve and decrypt objects from the artifacts S3 bucket. In the CodePipeline account, configure the CodePipeline CloudFormation action to use the roles.

**E:** In the development account and in the production account, create an IAM role for CodePipeline. Configure the roles with permissions to perform CloudFormation operations and with permissions to retrieve and decrypt objects from the artifacts S3 bucket. In the CodePipeline account, modify the artifacts S3 bucket policy to allow the roles access. Configure the CodePipeline CloudFormation action to use the roles.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 1 discussion

A company has a mobile application that makes HTTP API calls to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The ALB routes requests to an AWS Lambda function. Many different versions of the application are in use at any given time, including versions that are in testing by a subset of users. The version of the application is defined in the user-agent header that is sent with all requests to the API.
After a series of recent changes to the API, the company has observed issues with the application. The company needs to gather a metric for each API operation by response code for each version of the application that is in use. A DevOps engineer has modified the Lambda function to extract the API operation name, version information from the user-agent header and response code.
Which additional set of actions should the DevOps engineer take to gather the required metrics?

**A:** Modify the Lambda function to write the API operation name, response code, and version number as a log line to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Configure a CloudWatch Logs metric filter that increments a metric for each API operation name. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric.

**B:** Modify the Lambda function to write the API operation name, response code, and version number as a log line to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Configure a CloudWatch Logs Insights query to populate CloudWatch metrics from the log lines. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric.

**C:** Configure the ALB access logs to write to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. Modify the Lambda function to respond to the ALB with the API operation name, response code, and version number as response metadata. Configure a CloudWatch Logs metric filter that increments a metric for each API operation name. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric.

**D:** Configure AWS X-Ray integration on the Lambda function. Modify the Lambda function to create an X-Ray subsegment with the API operation name, response code, and version number. Configure X-Ray insights to extract an aggregated metric for each API operation name and to publish the metric to Amazon CloudWatch. Specify response code and application version as dimensions for the metric.

A business has an application that consists of five independent AWS Lambda functions.

The DevOps engineer has built a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild that builds, tests, packages, and deploys each Lambda function in sequence. The pipeline uses an Amazon EventBridge rule to ensure the pipeline starts as quickly as possible after a change is made to the application source code.

After working with the pipeline for a few months, the DevOps engineer has noticed the pipeline takes too long to complete.

What should the DevOps engineer implement to BEST improve the speed of the pipeline?

**A:** Modify the CodeBuild projects within the pipeline to use a compute type with more available network throughput.

**B:** Create a custom CodeBuild execution environment that includes a symmetric multiprocessing configuration to run the builds in parallel.

**C:** Modify the CodePipeline configuration to run actions for each Lambda function in parallel by specifying the same runOrder.

**D:** Modify each CodeBuild project to run within a VPC and use dedicated instances to increase throughput.



**Answer: C**

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 13 discussion

A company has a single AWS account that runs hundreds of Amazon EC2 instances in a single AWS Region. New EC2 instances are launched and terminated each hour in the account. The account also includes existing EC2 instances that have been running for longer than a week.
The company's security policy requires all running EC2 instances to use an EC2 instance profile. If an EC2 instance does not have an instance profile attached, the EC2 instance must use a default instance profile that has no IAM permissions assigned.
A DevOps engineer reviews the account and discovers EC2 instances that are running without an instance profile. During the review, the DevOps engineer also observes that new EC2 instances are being launched without an instance profile.
Which solution will ensure that an instance profile is attached to all existing and future EC2 instances in the Region?

**A:** Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts to EC2 RunInstances API calls. Configure the rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function to attach the default instance profile to the EC2 instances.

**B:** Configure the ec2-instance-profile-attached AWS Config managed rule with a trigger type of configuration changes. Configure an automatic remediation action that invokes an AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook to attach the default instance profile to the EC2 instances.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 38 discussion

A space exploration company receives telemetry data from multiple satellites. Small packets of data are received through Amazon API Gateway and are placed directly into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. A custom application is subscribed to the queue and transforms the data into a standard format.
Because of inconsistencies in the data that the satellites produce, the application is occasionally unable to transform the data. In these cases, the messages remain in the SQS queue. A DevOps engineer must develop a solution that retains the failed messages and makes them available to scientists for review and future processing.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

**A:** Configure AWS Lambda to poll the SQS queue and invoke a Lambda function to check whether the queue messages are valid. If validation fails, send a copy of the data that is not valid to an Amazon S3 bucket so that the scientists can review and correct the data. When the data is corrected, amend the message in the SQS queue by using a replay Lambda function with the corrected data.

**B:** Convert the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Configure AWS Lambda to poll the SQS queue every 10 minutes by using an Amazon EventBridge schedule. Invoke the Lambda function to identify any messages with a SentTimestamp value that is older than 5 minutes, push the data to the same location as the application's output location, and remove the messages from the queue.

**C:** Create an SQS dead-letter queue. Modify the existing queue by including a redrive policy that sets the Maximum Receives setting to 1 and sets the dead-letter queue ARN to the ARN of the newly created queue. Instruct the scientists to use the dead-letter queue to review the data that is not valid. Reprocess this data at a later time.

**D:** Configure API Gateway to send messages to different SQS virtual queues that are named for each of the satellites. Update the application to use a new virtual queue for any data that it cannot transform, and send the message to the new virtual queue. Instruct the scientists to use the virtual queue to review the data that is not valid. Reprocess this data at a later time.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 199 discussion

A company is migrating from its on-premises data center to AWS. The company currently uses a custom on-premises Cl/CD pipeline solution to build and package software.

The company wants its software packages and dependent public repositories to be available in AWS CodeArtifact to facilitate the creation of application-specific pipelines.

Which combination of steps should the company take to update the CI/CD pipeline solution and to configure CodeArtifact with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)

**A:** Update the C1ICD pipeline to create a VM image that contains newly packaged software. Use AWS Import/Export to make the VM image available as an Amazon EC2 AMI. Launch the AMI with an attached IAM instance profile that allows CodeArtifact actions. Use AWS CLI commands to publish the packages to a CodeArtifact repository.

**B:** Create an AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere trust anchor. Create an IAM role that allows CodeArtifact actions and that has a trust relationship on the trust anchor. Update the on-premises CI/CD pipeline to assume the new IAM role and to publish the packages to CodeArtifact.

**C:** Create a new Amazon S3 bucket. Generate a presigned URL that allows the PutObject request. Update the on-premises CI/CD pipeline to use the presigned URL to publish the packages from the on-premises location to the S3 bucket. Create an AWS Lambda function that runs when packages are created in the bucket through a put command. Configure the Lambda function to publish the packages to CodeArtifact.

**D:** For each public repository, create a CodeArutact repository that is configured with an external connection. Configure the dependent repositories as upstream public repositories.

**E:** Create a Codeartitact repository that is configured with a set of external connections to the public repositories. Configure the external connections to be downstream of the repository.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 2 discussion

A company provides an application to customers. The application has an Amazon API Gateway REST API that invokes an AWS Lambda function. On initialization, the Lambda function loads a large amount of data from an Amazon DynamoDB table. The data load process results in long cold-start times of 8-10 seconds. The DynamoDB table has DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) configured.
Customers report that the application intermittently takes a long time to respond to requests. The application receives thousands of requests throughout the day. In the middle of the day, the application experiences 10 times more requests than at any other time of the day. Near the end of the day, the application's request volume decreases to 10% of its normal total.
A DevOps engineer needs to reduce the latency of the Lambda function at all times of the day.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

**A:** Configure provisioned concurrency on the Lambda function with a concurrency value of 1. Delete the DAX cluster for the DynamoDB table.

**B:** Configure reserved concurrency on the Lambda function with a concurrency value of 0.

**C:** Configure provisioned concurrency on the Lambda function. Configure AWS Application Auto Scaling on the Lambda function with provisioned concurrency values set to a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 100.

**D:** Configure reserved concurrency on the Lambda function. Configure AWS Application Auto Scaling on the API Gateway API with a reserved concurrency maximum value of 100.

## Exam AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional DOP-C02 topic 1 question 201 discussion

A company recently deployed its web application on AWS. The company is preparing for a large-scale sales event and must ensure that the web application can scale to meet the demand.

The application's frontend infrastructure includes an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has an Amazon S3 bucket as an origin. The backend infrastructure includes an Amazon API Gateway API, several AWS Lambda functions, and an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

The company's DevOps engineer conducts a load test and identifies that the Lambda functions can fulfil the peak number of requests. However, the DevOps engineer notices request latency during the initial burst of requests. Most of the requests to the Lambda functions produce queries to the database. A large portion of the invocation time is used to establish database connections.

Which combination of steps will provide the application with the required scalability? (Choose three.)

**A:** Configure a higher reserved concurrency for the Lambda functions.

**B:** Configure a higher provisioned concurrency for the Lambda functions.

**C:** Convert the DB cluster to an Aurora global database. Add additional Aurora Replicas in AWS Regions based on the locations of the company's customers.

**D:** Refactor the Lambda functions. Move the code blocks that initialize database connections into the function handlers.

**E:** Use Amazon RDS Proxy to create a proxy for the Aurora database. Update the Lambda functions to use the proxy endpoints for database connections.
